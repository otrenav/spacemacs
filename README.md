# Spacemacs Configuration

- Omar Trejo
- July, 2017

This is my Spacemacs configuration. Feel free to use/adapt it. If you're going
to use my configuration, the `bookmarks` file is probably not useful for you, so
fix that, or delete it and adapt the `install.sh` accordingly. The rest of the
setup can be followed in the `install.sh` script.

If you don't know what it is, you should definitely check out the Spacemacs
project! It's a great way to enhance your Emacs experience. You can learn more
about it here: http://spacemacs.org/. To learn more about the GNU Emacs (the
best editor :P), go to: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/.
